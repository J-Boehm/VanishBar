# VanishBar
## A tool to hide the Windows taskbar

VanishBar is a Win32 console application written in C++ that has the ability to hide or show the Windows taskbar. This could be helpful in situations like the following one: You're trying to run LiteStep on top of Windows Explorer and you're having the problem that the Windows Explorer flickers through LiteStep.

### How to use it (the easy way)

Just start 'VanishBarUI.exe' and click 'Hide taskbar' to hide your taskbar or the other one to show your taskbar.

### How to use it (the not-so-easy-but-almost-invisible way)

You can use the console application by creating and running a shortcut of 'VanishBar.exe' with the following arguments.

Usage: VanishBar.exe [-t] -h/-s

* -t    When this argument is given, messages won't be shown.
* -c    Tells you, if your taskbar is visible or not. Using '-t' with this attribute is senseless.
* -h    Hide the taskbar
* -s    Show the taskbar again

Example:

`VanishBar.exe -t -h`   Hides the taskbar without showing messages.

The compiled application can be downloaded from the 'Debug' directory.
